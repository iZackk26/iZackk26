# Hi, I'm iZack

Thank you for being here. I hope you like all my projects and other stuff. I am a Computer Science student from Costa Rica, with a deep passion for exploring new things and learning as much as I can.

## What am I focusing on right now?
- I'm currently learning IA, Machine Learning and neuronal networks
- I'm currently learning Rust, Go and a little bit of Web Design
- I love to learn new things such as new programming languages, new trends, and I love to build computers and buy expensive stuff (Not very common).
- Feel free to visit my WebPage that is in process [WebPage Here!](https://www.izackk.com)
